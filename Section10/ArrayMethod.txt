1. slicing array:
    just like the slice method for string
    arr.slice(s,e);
    arr.slice(); //shallow copy

    splice method:
    similar to slice, but it remove the slicing elements in the original array.

2. reverse method:
    arr.reverse() // return the reversed array, meanwhile, it also mutates the original array

3. concat method:
    arr1.concat(arr2) // return a concatenated array, and does not mutate original arrays

4. forEach method:
    arr.forEach(func)
    // pass a callback function in the forEach method as argument
    // this function takes three parameters. func(ele,idx,arr) {...}
    // we cannot use break and continue in forEach method

    forEach() method can be also applied to set and map function(val,key,map), function(val,_,set)

5. DOM manipulation:
    ele.insertAdjacentHTML(position,text)
    // 1. the text will be parsed to HTML element, and will be attached to the DOM tree according to the position
    position param: "beforebegin","beforeend","afterend","afterbegin"

6. Array transformation methods:
    . map // similar to forEach function, but it return a new array after map function.
    . filter // return a boolean value in the function.
    . reduce // reduce takes two args (function(), intialVal)
    //function takes for args : accumulator,ele,idx,arr
    // the return value will be the accumulator in the next iteration. 
    //Finally return the accumulator value

7. chaining all the methods together
    but when we chain all the things together, sometimes it is hard to debug

8. find method
    arr.find(func())
    the func() returns a boolean value, which returns the first element that is true. If no matching value found, returns undefined

9. findIndex method
    arr.findIndex(funct()) // return the first index that is true

10. some and every methods
    arr.some(func())
    arr.every(func())
    similar to arr.includes(). return a boolean value, but includes can only pass number, some and every can pass condition.

11. flat, flatMap
    flat method flat the nested array.
    arr.flat(N) //N is the depth
    flatMap is a combination of flat and map method.
